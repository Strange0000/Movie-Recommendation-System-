Movie Recommendation System 🎬


The Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based web application that helps users discover movies similar to their favorite ones. Built using Streamlit, Pandas, and Pickle, this system utilizes a similarity matrix to recommend movies based on content similarity. Additionally, users can filter recommendations by genre for a more personalized experience.


🔹 Key Features:

✔️ Movie Similarity-Based Recommendations – Suggests movies based on content similarity.

✔️ Genre Filtering – Users can filter recommendations by selecting a specific genre.

✔️ Poster Fetching – Displays movie posters using the TMDb API.

✔️ Movie Ratings – Fetches and shows ratings for each recommended movie.

✔️ Interactive UI – Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use experience.


🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python 🐍

Streamlit 🎨 (For the web interface)

Pandas 📊 (For data processing)

Pickle 📦 (For storing similarity matrices)

TMDb API 🎥 (For fetching posters and ratings)



📂 Data Used:

movie_dict.pkl – Stores movie IDs and titles.

new.pkl – Contains detailed movie data (genre, cast, etc.).

similarity.pkl – Precomputed similarity matrix for recommendations.



💡 Future Improvements:


🔹 Implement collaborative filtering for better recommendations.

🔹 Add sorting options (popularity, release year, etc.).

🔹 Enhance UI with animations and user profiles.
